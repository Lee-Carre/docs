The navigation function allows you to reach your destination easily using voice guidance (optional).

## How to use

To start the navigation, you need to use the navigation button on the map screen. Next, you'll need to set the starting point and the destination. As for the starting point, you can choose your current location, [Favorite location](/osmand/map/point-layers-on-map#favorites), select a point on the map or use [an address](/osmand/search). You can also set a starting point by long tapping on the map and choosing ['Directions from'](/osmand/map/map-context-menu#directions-to--from) in [Map Context menu](/osmand/map/map-context-menu). To navigate to a point, just press the navigation button in its context menu.

 As soon as your points are selected, the app will create a route and will start guiding you after you tap "Start" button.

When the navigation is running, you can press the home button. You will get the message 'OsmAnd is running in the background'. This means that even if you turn the screen off or exit the active app window, you'll still get voice prompts. For Android versions other than 3.3, we have added the “Turn on screen” option. This allows you to show the map on the lock screen during navigation. Now, this function does not request any permissions for the correct operation. You can use it to save phone power. The function is configured separately for each profile. To configure, you need to select a profile that supports navigation and go to Profile settings - General settings - Screen control and enable the Screen timeout option (move the slider to the ON state - should turn blue).
