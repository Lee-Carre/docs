## General info

The Contour lines plugin is an autonomous functionality that can be enabled/disabled as needed. The plugin provides for downloading the following maps: 

- the **Contour lines** map in vector points, and
- two Terrain maps in raster pixels: the **Hillshade** map, and the **Slopes** map. 

Each map of the Contour lines plugin is an independent option, which if toggled on, is displayed above, or underneath the Map Source. 

The terrain information on the map can be represented by hill shading, with the contour lines of the uphill and downhill, as an angle of diviation from flat. By means of contour lines, shades and colors, the map shows slopes, peaks, rugged terrain, and other elevation above the sea level. 

The global data for the map - between 70 degrees north and 70 degrees south - is based on the measurements made by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (abbrev.as *SRTM*). It uses the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (abbrev. as *ASTER*), which is a sensor onboard the Terra satellite and the flagship imaging instrument of NASA's Earth Observing System. ASTER is a cooperative effort between NASA, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (abbrev. as *METI*), and Japan Space Systems (also known as *J-spacesystems*).
