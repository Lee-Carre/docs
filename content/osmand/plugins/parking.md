## Overview 

A Parking point on the map and a notice in the calendar are provided by the Parking plugin. It is free, and works well with the downloaded OsmAnd Maps and Navigation. A Parking point will help you remember the exact location of where the car is left as well as to stay aware of how far it is already from your parking spot, and if needed, to return on time, avoid additional unnecessary costs, share the location with your loved ones. It is easy to set a Parking point, with or without time-tracking, and to remove it after successful use.

## Parking point on the map

When a Parking point shows up on the map, it acquires the latitude and longitude of the selected geolocation, and the timestamp of the creation moment. It helps visually to identify the parking both when setting the point and when further tracking it as well as using for navigation, if necessary. There are a number of ways of how to store the parking information and use it for checking out the time, and/or location. 


###  Set a point

{% data reusables.general.android-ios-switcher %}

{% default %}

To set a Parking point on the map, zoom in to the required level, then long-tap a spot on the map, and in the opened [Context menu](/osmand/map/map-context-menu), do the following: 

1. Tap [**Actions**](/osmand/map/map-context-menu#-add--delete-parking-point).
2. Tap **Parking**.
3. If needed, set time, and add a reminder to the Calendar app. 
4. **Save** the point. 

![Set Parking point in iOS](/assets/images/plugins/parking/ios_set_p_point_limit.png) ![Set Parking point in Android](/assets/images/plugins/parking/and_set_p_point_limit.png) 

{% enddefault %}

{% ios%}

1. Tap **{% data variables.ios-values.actions %}**, and then tap **{% data variables.ios-values.add_parking_short %}**.
2. Consider time limits in the opened {% data variables.ios-values.parking_marker %} dialog. If a time limit is needed, enable the **{% data variables.ios-values.time_limited %}** option, and establish the following:

    - time when to end parking;
    - reminder for the Calendar app.

3. Tap **Save**, and the point will be set on the map.

2. Consider time limits in the opened {% data variables.android-values.parking_options %} dialog: 

    - If there is no time limit, select the **{% data variables.android-values.osmand_parking_no_lim_text %}** option, and the point without time constraints will be set on the map. 

    - If a time limit is required, select the **{% data variables.android-values.osmand_parking_time_limit %}** option, and then: 
        - select time when to end parking;
        - add reminder for the Calendar app;
        - tap **OK**, and the point with the established time limit will be set on the map. .

{% endandroid%}

>**NOTE**: The start time is always established automatically for the Parking point. The end time, if selected to be set for the Parking point, can be re-added anew only, not edited. The expected end time of the parking reminder in the Calendar app can be updated as needed.

### Stay informed

{% data reusables.general.android-ios-switcher %}

{% default %}

To stay aware of the parking location and the time, after a Parking point is set, you can use: the [Parking widget](/osmand/widgets/info-widgets#-parking-widget) and the context menu of the point on the map. 

#### LOCATION

**Location** is revealed by the [Parking widget](/osmand/widgets/info-widgets#-parking-widget). It helps to see the distance from your current location, or the center of the screen to the Parking point. Additionally, by tapping the widget the map immediately brings the Parking point into the center of your screen. 

![Parking widget iOS](/assets/images/plugins/parking/parking_widget_ios.png) ![Parking widget Android](/assets/images/plugins/parking/parking_widget_android.png)

To see the time left or overdue, tap the time-limited Parking point, and the opened context menu will show you when Parking was expected to be ended.
