To restore a purchased app, just visit **Google Play** and reinstall it. If you've already purchased the app with your current Google account, you'll be able to redownload it on each app you use.

To restore a purchase from **Amazon**, navigate through the app as though you were going to purchase the feature again. At the point where you would ordinarily be charged, Amazon instead realizes that you've already purchased it in the past and activates it again for free.
