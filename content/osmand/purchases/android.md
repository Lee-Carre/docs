## Legacy subscriptions (prior 4.0)

New subscriptions became active from OsmAnd 4.0 (August 2021). All earlier subscriptions are legacy and techncically equal to "Maps subscription", though legacy subscriptions are entitled for Hourly Map updates. Users can't buy legacy subscriptions but old subscriptions are automatically renewed until the user unsubscribes (the price for them might change in the future).


## Restore purchases

To restore a purchased app, just visit **Google Play** and reinstall it. If you've already purchased the app with your current Google account, you'll be able to redownload it on each app you use.

To restore a purchase from **Amazon**, navigate through the app as though you were going to purchase the feature again. At the point where you would ordinarily be charged, Amazon instead realizes that you've already purchased it in the past and activates it again for free.

## Giftcards

User can purchase OsmAnd using Google Play / Amazon giftcards. This method does not imply sharing a credit card information to the online services. Just purchase a gift card from any retailer available to you and redeem the code on Google Play / Amazon.
