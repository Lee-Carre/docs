### New device / new account
* **Android**. Just enter Google Play using the same account you used to buy OsmAnd, then find OsmAnd through Search and install it again. Make sure you install OsmAnd+ if you have bought it or install OsmAnd if you have bought in app.
* **iOS**. All you have to do is enter the App store and install OsmAnd again. You can use it on as many devices as you want without the need to buy the app again. You may see the "Buy" button, but you won't have to pay: just press it to download the app without paying again.
