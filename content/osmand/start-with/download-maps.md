When the app is launching for the first time,  appears a suggestion  to download the map. This allows OsmAnd to determine location of the device  and will offer you to download the current region map. It is possible to select another region or skip downloading by clicking 'Skip' in the top-right corner.

> NOTE: The "Mini world overview map"  will be downloaded by default. We recommend downloading the "World overview map". This is a basic map that allows you to view regions and countries.

> NOTE: In order to use maps in offline mode, you need to preload required maps. OsmAnd use  maps  in .obf  format.

There are two main map types you can use: vector and raster:
- Vector maps is a database of points, lines and polygons which collectively make up all the features on the map. This map format is relatively small in size and easy to download and convenient for offline use.
- Raster map is a  electronic map image made up of a set number of pixels. This type of maps is more voluminous, requires a longer download and cannot always be used offline. More details can be found in the [Online / Offline Raster Maps](/osmand/map/online-raster-maps) section. 

In order to use navigation conveniently and quickly  in offline mode, we recommend downloading offline maps.

## How to use vector maps

All "vector" maps in OsmAnd have native format. They are compact and allows  easily zooming without losing detail or resolution. 

{% data variables.product.android_button_seq %} {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_menu %} → {% data variables.android-values.welmode_download_maps %}

{% data variables.product.ios_button_seq %} {% data variables.ios-values.menu %} → {% data variables.ios-values.res_mapsres %}

The list of maps to download will appear. User can use the search (magnifying glass) at the left top corner to find necessary region.

<!-- ## Prepared maps

Users can make their own maps using **OsmAnd Map Creator**.  Prepare the maps on your PC and transfer them to the "OsmAnd" folder on your device. You might need to restart the app afterward.-->
