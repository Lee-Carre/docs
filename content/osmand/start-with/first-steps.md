## Welcome to OsmAnd!

Our goal is to create fully functional Map-oriented application that could be used offline in various purposes. The application is full of features, so you don't need to switch between different apps and have everything at your fingertips:
- Browse Worldwide Map with lots of details displayed with [many map styles](/osmand/map/vector-maps).
- Display, search and save various [Points of interests](/osmand/map/point-layers-on-map).
- [Plan a route](/osmand/plan-route/create-route) by car, bicycle, foot and combine it.
- Start [voice guided navigation](/osmand/navigation/route-navigation) with screen on and off.
- Make your tourist trip rich with offline [Wikipedia](/osmand/plugins/wikipedia) and [Wikivoyage](/osmand/plan-route/travel-guides).
- Fully customize how [the map displayed](/osmand/map/configure-map-menu) and what [widgets](/osmand/widgets) are displayed on it.
- Navigate [by boat](/osmand/navigation/boat-navigation), [by a given track](/osmand/navigation/gpx-navigation), [by public transport](/osmand/navigation/public-transport-navigation) and [offroad](/osmand/navigation/markers-navigation).
- Everything works in **Offline Mode**!
- And don't forget to contribute to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) with [OSM Editing Plugin](/osmand/plugins/osm-editing).

## Privacy

It is an [open source](https://github.com/osmandapp/osmand), ads-free / tracker-free privacy focused application. In order to preserve maximum privacy, OsmAnd offers Offline maps as a first place, so no interaction, geo information is leaked from your device. We are very attentive to what data is collected and what data is transferred by network, you can read more in our [Privacy policy](https://osmand.net/help-online/privacy-policy). 

## Permissions

OsmAnd doesn't have any required permissions on iOS / Android version. 

**Essential**:
- **Internet** - initial download / update offline maps. Also could be needed to access online features such as [Street Level Imagery](/osmand/map/point-layers-on-map#-street-level-imagery), [Online photos](/osmand/map/map-context-menu#online-photos) or [Online maps](/osmand/map/raster-maps).
- **GPS** / **GSM Network** - determine your location, follow you in a navigation mode, record your trip (optional). This permission is asked when you click [my location button](/osmand/widgets/map-buttons#my-location--zoom) or when you [start navigation](/osmand/navigation/route-navigation).

**Optional**:
- **Camera/voice recording** (Android) - only used by [the Audio/Video notes](/osmand/plugins/audio-video-notes). This feature is packaged as plugin and by default disabled. It allows to quickly create location-related audio/video notes during a trip.


## Actions Guide

### How to download maps

OsmAnd is an offline map application, so after '{% data variables.android-values.get_started %}' screen, you will be proposed to download map of your region. You can select another region or skip this step and download map later. 

**Note**: Application is not properly functional without offline maps which are not distributed within application. Even though application supports [Vector maps](/osmand/map/vector-maps) and  [Raster maps](/osmand/map/raster-maps), it is highly recommend to start with Offline Vector Maps to get all features properly functioning such as [Search](/osmand/search), [Navigation](//osmand/navigation),  [Context menu](/osmand/map/map-context-menu).
