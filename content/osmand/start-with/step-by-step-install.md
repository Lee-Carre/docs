There is an opportunity to download OsmAnd for **Android** and **iOS**.

For **Android** there is an option to download from [Google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand&hl=en&gl=US), [Huawei AppGallery](https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C101486545), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/OsmAnd-Maps-Navigation/dp/B00D0SA8I8/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=osmand&qid=1616685559&sr=8-3).

For **iOS** there is an option to download from [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/osmand-maps-travel-navigate/id934850257).

For more information about OsmAnd versions and paid services with extended functionality see the [Purchases info](docs/content/osmand/purchases/index.md).

After installation open OsmAnd and press '{% data variables.android-values.get_started %}'.

**Welcome in OsmAnd!**

It is important to download the maps. User can do it immediately or press the '{% data variables.android-values.shared_string_skip %}' button in the top right corner to download maps later.

If the user gives OsmAnd permission to determine the location it will suggest maps to download for the current region. User can select another region if it is necessary.

> **Note (for Android)**: It will be an announcement about data storage at the bottom of the screen. By default, OsmAnd uses  External storage, but the user can change it anytime. {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_menu %} → {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_settings %} → {% data variables.android-values.osmand_settings %} → {% data variables.android-values.application_dir %} → {% data variables.android-values.change_data_storage_folder %}. For more information, click [Storage](../start-with/storage.md).

If you want to reinstall the app, please make sure you have back up all your data such as Tracks and Favorites.
