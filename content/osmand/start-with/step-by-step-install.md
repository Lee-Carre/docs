### Install OsmAnd
OsmAnd is a mobile application available for **Android** and **iOS**. You can download it on most popular Application Stores.

**Android markets**: [Google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand&hl=en&gl=US), [Huawei AppGallery](https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C101486545), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/OsmAnd-Maps-Navigation/dp/B00D0SA8I8/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=osmand&qid=1616685559&sr=8-3). More information about OsmAnd versions and paid services is available at [Purchases info](/osmand/purchases).  

**iOS**: [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/osmand-maps-travel-navigate/id934850257).

### Welcome to OsmAnd!

OsmAnd is an offline map application, so after '{% data variables.android-values.get_started %}' screen, you will be proposed to download map of your region. If you skip maps download (via '{% data variables.android-values.shared_string_skip %}'), the application won't function correctly. So you will need to download maps later via Android / iOS -> Menu -> Maps download (TODO). OsmAnd might not detect your region to download correctly, so you can choose from the list.

**Android storage**. On Android devices your might want to change where the maps stored, on shared storage, sdcard, etc. You can read more about it on [Storage](/osmand/start-with/storage).

In case you need to reinstall the app, please make sure you have back up all your [Personal Data](/osmand/import-export) data such as Tracks and Favorites.
